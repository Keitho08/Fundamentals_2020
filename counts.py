# Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as
# input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of
# times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A']
# should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend
# on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task
# first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.
